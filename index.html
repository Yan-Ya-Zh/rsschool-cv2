        <li>I am studying at the rsschool to become a good developer. 
            I try to complete the entire task to the maximum number of points. 
            Previously, I was not involved with development or layout, but now I want to be involved with development and change my life! 
            I quickly learn what I like and I will never miss a development opportunity at Rolling Scopes School.</li>
        <li>Previously, I was not associated with development, but I tried to practice a little, and I am familiar with the VSCode editor, HTML, CSS, Photoshop and Figma.</li>
